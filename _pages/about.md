Hello! My name is Taylor Frizzell and I am a recent graduate engineer based in Nashville, Tennessee. 
Iâ€™ve been programming and tinkering with electronics since high school and have always had a passion for it. I'm also a hobbyist game developer.
Outside of programming, I enjoy reading and working on my side projects. I try to document progress or drastic changes, which is listed under projects.	In the future I would love to start my own software company. One thing at a time though...
