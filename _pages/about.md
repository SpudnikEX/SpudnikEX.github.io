Hello! My name is Taylor Frizzell and I am a recent graduate engineer based in Nashville, Tennessee. 
Iâ€™ve been programming and tinkering with electronics since high school and have always had a passion for it. I'm also a hobbyist game developer.
Outside of programming, I enjoy reading and working on my side projects. 
I enjoy documenting projects, journals, or random things in my https://obsidian.md/.
In the future I would love to start my own software company. 

Relevant links are on the sidebar, as well as the bottom of the page.
