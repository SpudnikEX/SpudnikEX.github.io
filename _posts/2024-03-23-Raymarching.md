# Raymarching in Rust
In an effort to learn rust, what better project to get started than a raymarcher/
Rust in an embedded systems language, promising the speed of C++ while offering memory safety.

Rather than outputting , I opted to run my code through a fragment shader on the gpu using [Vulkano](https://vulkano.rs/).
Vulkano is an abstraction library that simplifies the process of window creation and rendering images through shaders.
